/**
 * Parameters for a product search request.
 *
 * @property {Object} boundingPoly
 *   The bounding polygon around the area of interest in the image.
 *   Optional. If it is not specified, system discretion will be applied.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [BoundingPoly]{@link google.cloud.vision.v1.BoundingPoly}
 *
 * @property {string} productSet
 *   The resource name of a ProductSet to be searched for similar images.
 *
 *   Format is:
 *   `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID/productSets/PRODUCT_SET_ID`.
 *
 * @property {string[]} productCategories
 *   The list of product categories to search in. Currently, we only consider
 *   the first category, and either "homegoods", "apparel", or "toys" should be
 *   specified.
 *
 * @property {string} filter
 *   The filtering expression. This can be used to restrict search results based
 *   on Product labels. We currently support an AND of OR of key-value
 *   expressions, where each expression within an OR must have the same key.
 *
 *   For example, "(color = red OR color = blue) AND brand = Google" is
 *   acceptable, but not "(color = red OR brand = Google)" or "color: red".
 *
 * @typedef ProductSearchParams
 * @memberof google.cloud.vision.v1
 * @see [google.cloud.vision.v1.ProductSearchParams definition in proto format]{@link https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/cloud/vision/v1/product_search.proto}

/**
 * Results for a product search request.
 *
 * @property {Object} indexTime
 *   Timestamp of the index which provided these results. Changes made after
 *   this time are not reflected in the current results.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Timestamp]{@link google.protobuf.Timestamp}
 *
 * @property {Object[]} results
 *   List of results, one for each product match.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Result]{@link google.cloud.vision.v1.Result}
 *
 * @property {Object[]} productGroupedResults
 *   List of results grouped by products detected in the query image. Each entry
 *   corresponds to one bounding polygon in the query image, and contains the
 *   matching products specific to that region. There may be duplicate product
 *   matches in the union of all the per-product results.

 *   This object should have the same structure as [GroupedResult]{@link google.cloud.vision.v1.GroupedResult}
